GjsUnit
=======

Gjs comes with JsUnit, but I was not really satisfied by using it. So here is GjsUnit, a Js unit test utility written in the "Gnome" flavour.

GjsUnit is made of only one Js file you can add to your projects and start testing your applications.

This repository is made of 3 files:
- gjsunit.js the test framework itself
- t_gjsunit.js a test suite to illustrates how to use GjsUnit
- run.js the file to run the tests.
